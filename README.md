## News: 09/01/23
I have launched a new project, [nyvia-academy](https://github.com/nyvia-projects/nyvia-academy).

I've been gathering valuable coding resources and notes since 2015 and plan to curate them into a repository for public access, with potential expansion into video lessons, while aiming to create an accessible webpage using tools like **Nextra.js** or **Obsidian Vault**.
